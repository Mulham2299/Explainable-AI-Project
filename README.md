# ðŸ§  Explainable LLM Prototype â€“ ChatGPT-Inspired Transparency System

This project was developed at Northumbria University as part of a multidisciplinary collaboration. It explores how to make Large Language Models (LLMs) more transparent and interpretable for users, drawing inspiration from ChatGPT and explainable AI principles.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Improve transparency in LLM outputs
- Visualize internal model parameters and decision pathways
- Design user interfaces that enhance comprehension and trust
- Apply design thinking and iterative feedback to refine clarity
